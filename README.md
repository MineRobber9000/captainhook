## Captain Hook

*Set a github IRC service hook for all repos in your org.*

Sick of manually adding IRC hooks for each new repo. Run this to set
them all at once.

Prompts for the following info when you run it:
* Github username
* Github password
* Github org name
* IRCd hostname
* IRC Channel::password

Then prompts for each org. Check source.
